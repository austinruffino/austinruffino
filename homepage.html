        <p>
            I see you've found my website. Allow me to introduce myself.

        <p>
            My name is Austin Ruffino, and I'm currently an undergraduate Business Administration Student in college. I have experience with Technical Theatre, Computer Programming, and I also speak some French! I love hiking, robotics, ice hockey, soccer, and especially love Broadway theatre.
